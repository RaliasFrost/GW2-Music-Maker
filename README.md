# GW2-Music-Maker
A tool that can be used to create music sheets for Guild Wars Two Musical instruments

This is a application/tool that i am devolaping for my guild on Guild Wars 2 to help aid it's members write musical notation for songs and
music in general.

I put the code up here for public general usage, as I do not plan on making money off of this, and I would rather people  be able to learn 
from my code.
